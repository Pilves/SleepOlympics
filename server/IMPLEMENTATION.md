# Sleep Olympics Backend Implementation

This document summarizes the backend implementation for the Sleep Olympics application and outlines the next steps in the development process.

## Implemented Features

### Project Structure

The backend follows a modular structure with separate routes and controllers for each major feature area:

```
server/
  ├── controllers/       # Business logic for handling requests
  ├── middleware/        # Auth and validation middleware
  ├── routes/            # API route definitions
  ├── utils/             # Utility functions and helpers
  ├── .env               # Environment variables
  ├── index.js           # Main entry point
  └── serviceAccountKey.json  # Firebase credentials (not in repo)
```

### Core Components

1. **Firebase Integration**
   - Firebase Admin setup for authentication and Firestore database access
   - Development mode with mock Firebase implementation for testing without credentials

2. **Authentication System**
   - User registration with invitation code validation
   - Password reset functionality
   - JWT-based authentication middleware
   - Role-based access control for admin endpoints

3. **User Management**
   - User profile creation and updates
   - Notification preferences management
   - Oura Ring integration endpoints

4. **Sleep Data**
   - Endpoints for retrieving and storing sleep data
   - Date-based and range-based queries
   - Oura sleep data synchronization
   - Sleep summary calculations and aggregations

5. **Competition System**
   - Competition creation and management
   - User participation handling (join/leave)
   - Leaderboard generation and retrieval
   - Winner determination and prize tracking

6. **Notification System**
   - User notification creation and delivery
   - Notification read status management
   - Bulk notification capabilities for system announcements

7. **Invitation System**
   - Invitation-only registration workflow
   - Invitation code generation and validation
   - Invitation tracking and management

## Development Environment

- Express.js server with RESTful API architecture
- Middleware for CORS, JSON parsing, and logging
- Error handling middleware
- Development mode with nodemon for hot reloading

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Add Jest tests for controller functions
- **Integration Testing**: Test API endpoints with Supertest
- **Mock Testing**: Develop better Firebase mock implementations for testing

### 2. Authentication Enhancements

- Add refresh token functionality
- Implement OAuth integration for social login options
- Add email verification workflow

### 3. Data Processing

- Implement robust Oura API integration with proper error handling
- Add data processing queue for handling large imports
- Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data

### 4. Security Improvements

- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Implement request validation with Joi or similar
- Add comprehensive input sanitization
- Set up proper CORS configuration for production

### 5. Competition System Enhancements

- Implement scheduled tasks for competition status updates
- Add more competition types and scoring algorithms
- Implement notifications for competition events

### 6. Deployment

- Configure production environment variables
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Add database backup solutions

### 7. Documentation

- Generate API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Create comprehensive setup guide
- Document database schema and relationships

### 8. Performance Optimization

- Implement database query optimization
- Add pagination for large data sets
- Set up caching for common queries

## Known Issues

1. Firebase mock implementation is basic and needs expansion
2. Error handling can be improved with more specific error types
3. Need to implement proper data validation throughout controllers
4. Security hardening required before production deployment
